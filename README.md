# CytochromeB_Genotyping_Species_Identification
Determine exact species by cytochrome b genotyping. This program trims numerous multifasta files generated from sanger sequencing, merges the trimmed files to generate one multifasta file with all sequences. Run NCBI BLAST, parse XML file to species name from top hit.
